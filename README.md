# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. The project is designed around the hypothetical Triple Espresso Coffee shop, and functions as a landing page. Currently the landing page has self referential links (all links will not take you off the landing page). I have plans to expand the project and give certain links, like the social icon links, real meaning in the future. Moreover, i plan on adding more pages to the site as well.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future i will be adding new pages to the site, so it functions as more than a landing page. Moreover, i need to fix links that have no address that they link to, for example, the social media icons in the footer. Adding more animations & graphics is something that i look forward to as well!
